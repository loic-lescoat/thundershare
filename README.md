# Thundershare âš¡ Share files over your LAN with ease

## What problem does this project solve?

Ever notice how the quickest way to send a file or some text from your mobile phone
to your computer is often to e-mail it to yourself?
In this day an age, how ridiculous!

Thundershare lets you send files over a home network with ease.
Simply navigate to `<ip of machine running the app>:8000`
to upload and download files you want shared locally.

Files never leave the host machine - sleep soundly
knowing your files are safe.
